Please contribute to the "Testing" branch. It will later be merged with "master" when everything is confirmed to be Stable. This is so `git clone` can be used.

If you are adding or removing dependencies, features, or settings, please update README.md!

Don't just delete the whole project or troll....

Make sure you have tested everything before committing.
